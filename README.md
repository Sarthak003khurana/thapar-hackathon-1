🚀 TranquilMinds - Mental Health Support Platform
We participated in the HackSphire 1.0 Hackathon held at Thapar University and proudly cleared 4 checkpoints along with the pitching round, earning a place among the finalist teams! 🏆

Our project, TranquilMinds, is a mental wellness platform soon to be converted into a mobile application for both iOS and Android users 📱✨.

🌟 About TranquilMinds
TranquilMinds is designed to support people suffering from:

Anxiety 😟

Anger issues 😡

Mental stress 😰

Social anxiety 😥

Many individuals hesitate to talk to their family or friends during tough times. That's why our app’s Unique Selling Point (USP) is the One-Tap Emergency Call 📞 feature:

In moments of high anxiety or stress, users can simply tap a button and get connected to a professional in less than one minute, available 24/7! ⏳

We plan to hire psychology students and certified doctors 🩺 to ensure people receive the right help instantly.
